<p> CONVERGENCIA (2020)
<br>
<br>
CONVERGENCIA (CONVERGENCE) is a collective, participatory film project developed during quarantine, gathering audiovisual material from 12 people all across Bolivia, to manifest our lifestyles from a non-anthropocentric lense.
<br>
Focusing on the body as an object of investigation and working tool, this dynamic was facilitated through a cross-pollinated insight between body, word, camera and image.
The project was worked wholly digital manner, facilitating dialogues and the production of material through online conferences.
<br>
<br>
CONVERGENCE was possible with the funding support of the Municipal Funds for Arts and Culture FOCUART 2020, La Paz, Bolivia.

<p> hola casita (2020)
<br>
<br>
Experimental short-film  commissioned by Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance for their Isolation Series during the quarantine.
<br>
Responding to the experience of lockdown in my hometown of La Paz, Bolivia, the film welcomes the viewer into moments of intimacy between a home and its inhabitants. Translated as ‘hello little house’, the project portrays part of the process of my home-coming after studying abroad for five years. It is a collage of rediscovery and experience.
<br>
<br>
The film is a poetic registry of the everyday interactions that happen in a territory defined by the walls of a house. Amidst a complex global crisis, that is felt locally and personally, the project aims to bridge multiple layers of socio-political action that are urgent and possible, from the soil to the computer.
<br>
While decentralizing the human from the concept of 'home', the project aims to inspire dancers and non-dancers to think of the framing of their everyday lives as a tool for self-investigation and introspection. The film encourages people to understand that living is the fundamental job, in addition to how our ability to perceive is our most important communicative tool.
