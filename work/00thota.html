<p> AMLA (2020)
<br>
‘AMLA’ is a conglomerate of collective autobiographical material that was shaped into a scenographic proposal of images, bodily textures and collective temperatures referent to the everyday processes of the performers.
<br>
The piece is a culmination of a series of participatory processes of introspection, developing a speculative exercise of deep democracy that departs from subjective insight. ‘AMLA’ looks into the manifestation of multiplicity within a group of Bolivian youngsters, doing a study of Zavaleta’s concept of ‘abigarramiento’ (translated into english as variegation), utilising frameworks of mass, movement and meaning to navigate intimacies that are individual, collective and speculatively speaking universal.
<br>
This project is a continuation of my ongoing research on human ecology within modern, colonial, queer and mestizo realities.
<br>
AMLA was performed by a group of 8 performers, in collaboration with Scenographer Ariel Hurtado and light designer Gabriela Tapia Lara.
The piece was commissioned by Fases Bolivia and it was presented at the Cultural Centre of Plurinationality in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, within the program of the International Festival of Contemporary Dance of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia.

<p>e n t r o p i a (2019)
<br>
My gratitude is to time, light and gravity for birthing life and reality as we know it: our ancestors who shaped us, the inner child that enlightens us and our mothers who gave birth to us. The universe exists more as we witness it, and so do we as we exist in it. There is enough information in every and each one of us to create speculative landscapes of information.
<br>
Now, together, we become, we process, we digest. Each one of us is a unit and our collective spirit dances in the space we inhabit.
<br>
<br>
Impulsed by the intention to understand what is it that we can call ‘environmental choreography’,  ‘entropia' began as an investigation of modern human ecology, using the human body as a symptomatic tool to manifest its environment. The piece resulted as a metaphorical journey through multiple phenomenological layers that constituted its presentation, from academic expectations, and anxious states of being, to cosmological forces.
<br>
Intrigued by the empirical insight of the second thermodynamic law,  as well as insights on the nature of processes in any given system from the lens of Systems Theory and Process Work, the piece was a choreographic facilitation of collectiveness, physical textures, corporeal realities and fabulation of the cosmos.
<br>
The piece was performed by a team of 17 dancers, in collaboration with light designer PJ Davy and fashion designer Jawara Alleyne. It was presented at the Bonnie Bird Theatre at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London.

<p> Elettra (2019)
<br>
Worked with performer Elettra Piaggi, an introspection into her intimate life story, focusing on traumas lived through the compromises and objectifications of her female body within the patriarchal and heavily sexist society that is her home country Italy.
The solo work emerged from an investigation of gravity in the body, looking at how tension and momentum emerged from the relationships between the weight of her own body and the floor. This interest bridged a metaphorical praxis between her own personal story and the movement nature of the piece. Similarly, the costume was designed as another metaphorical extension of the phenomena encountered, giving some kind of prosthetic arms that turned the performer into a fictional character of herself.
<br>
The solo was performed by myself since Elettra got injured a week before the performance. It was presented at the Bonnie Bird Theatre at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London.

<p> starling (2019)
<br>
A durational performance-installation work where a microenvironment is created using found objects in my room. In the pursuit of understanding ones own ecology, this performance made reference to the starling birds, exercising the ontological sense of self through the relationships with the other, in this case objets I accumulated through my sense of possession. The performance enabled the audience to enter deep layers of my own intimacy, enabling a constant emergence of memories and desires through the stimulus that this object constellation offered.
<br>
The performance was presented at the independent art event RIPOSTE and it was then restaged for the Symposium ‘Staying with the Trouble: Difficulties in Dance Discourse’ held at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, alongside artists such as Eve Stainton, Alice Weber, Jianan Qu and others; both events took place in London.

<p> my heart is too big for you (2018)
<br>
in collaboration with India De Vere
<br>
An abstraction of the subconscious of a shared affection. The piece is an improvisation structured by conceptual and physical elements encountered during our friendship, questioning conventions of choreographic practice within the institution we were studying at and exercising different praxis of on-site-live-choreography through the performance of sound.
<br>
This piece was presented at the Bonnie Bird Theatre at Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, London.
