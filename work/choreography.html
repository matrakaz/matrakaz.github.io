<p> AMLA
<br>
‘AMLA’ is a conglomerate of collective autobiographical material that was shaped into a scenographic proposal of images, bodily textures and collective temperatures referent to the everyday processes of the performers.
<br>
The piece is a culmination of a series of participatory processes of introspection, developing a speculative exercise of deep democracy that departs from subjective insight. ‘AMLA’ looks into the manifestation of multiplicity within a group of Bolivian youngsters, doing a study of Zavaleta’s concept of ‘abigarramiento’ (translated into english as variegation), utilising frameworks of mass, movement and meaning to navigate intimacies that are individual, collective and speculatively speaking universal.
<br>
This project is a continuation of my ongoing research on human ecology within modern, colonial, queer and mestizo realities.
<br>
AMLA was performed by a group of 8 performers, in collaboration with Scenographer Ariel Hurtado and light designer Gabriela Tapia Lara.
The piece was commissioned by Fases Bolivia and it was presented at the Cultural Centre of Plurinationality in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, within the program of the International Festival of Contemporary Dance of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia.
