<a href=CV.html>CV</a>

<p> Luisa Mateo Dupleich Rozo is a Bolivian multidisciplinary artist, facilitator and investigator who lives and works in La Paz and London.
<br>
<br>
Luisa began training classical technique at the Escuela de Ballet Cubano-Boliviana in La Paz at the age of 6 (Bolivia, 2004-2011) and continued training other contemporary and modern techniques in her hometown.
<br>
At the age of 16, Luisa left Bolivia under a full scholarship to complete the International Baccalaureate at the United World Colleges: Red Cross Nordic (Norway, 2013-2015), followed by her completion of a Contemporary Dance Bachelors Degree at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, receiving an honorary mention. (England, 2016-2019).
<br>
<br>
Luisa started her professional performing career in Bolivia at a very early age, from collaborating in Maque Pereyra’s first choreographic investigations such as ‘es.pejo.es’ (Bolivia, 2012) to having the leading role in the revival of Norma Quintana’s 1996 neoclassical piece ‘The Passion of The Christ According to St. Luke’ (Bolivia, 2016).
She has worked and collaborated with artists such as Monika Błaszczak (Poland), Sasha Pirogova (Russia), Alice Anderson (France-UK), Anna Talvi (Estonia), Jana Winderen (Norway), Maria Gorodeckaya (Russia), Sylbee Kim (South Korea), Cõvco (DRC-London), Hagit Yakira (Israel), Jianan Qu (China), Daniel Jacoby (Peru), Stella Scott (UK), Jawara Alleyne (Jamaica-Cayman Islands), among others.
<br>
Simultaneously, Luisa did various kinds of placements and residencies, being able to observe and interact intimately with Teatro de los Andes (Bolivia), Dimitris Papaioannou (Greece), Peeping Tom (Belgium), Candoco Dance Company (UK), Marina Collard (UK) and Rahel Vonmoos (Switzerland).
<br>
<br>
Luisa has presented a number of choreographic pieces in dance theatres, galleries, outdoors and other informal spaces, such as ‘Baltering’ (Norway, 2015), ‘entropia’ (England, 2019), ‘AMLA’ (Bolivia 2020) Swięto Wiosny: Preludium (Poland, 2021-22) and The Heart of the Anchoress (England, 2022).
<br>
<br>
Luisa’s work investigates the body as an instrument to develop processing. Her choreographic ongoing research focuses on the urge to understand the systems that constitute our life as we know it, from the celular, nervous or cognitive to the sociopolitical, cultural and physical.
<br>
The devotion to scenographic and performance oriented work stems from the desire to communicate in languages that enable our multiplicity and subjectivity to manifest, in a constant search to decolonise our languages and give a space for the unheard processes that constitute our identities. Investigating the human ecology through dialogues with our modern, urban and digital contexts is paramount in Luisa's practice in order to get closer to healthier relationships with our history, our contexts and our environment.
<br>
<br>
Luisa works simultaneously as a creative consultant, producer, cultural organiser, curator, dj, fundraiser, technician and translator. </p>
