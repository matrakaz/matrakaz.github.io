<p> Luisa Mateo Dupleich Rozo is a Bolivian multidisciplinary artist, facilitator and investigator who lives and works in La Paz and London.
<br>
<br>
Luisa’s work investigates the body as an instrument to develop processing. Her choreographic ongoing research focuses on the urge to understand the systems that constitute our life as we know it, from the cellular, nervous and cognitive to the physical, cultural and sociopolitical.
<br>
The devotion to scenographic and performance oriented work stems from the desire to communicate in languages that enable our multiplicity and subjectivity to manifest, in a constant search to decolonise our languages and give a space for the unheard processes that constitute our identities. Investigating the human ecology through dialogues with our modern, urban and digital contexts is paramount in Luisa's practice in order to get closer to healthier relationships with our history, our contexts and our environment.
<br>
<br>
Luisa's creative direction and choreographic practice has been in constant evolution. Her large scale productions are The Heart of the Anchoress (England, 2022), Święto Wiosny: Preludium (Poland, 2021-22), ‘AMLA’ (Bolivia 2020), ‘entropia’ (England, 2019), and ‘Baltering’ (Norway, 2015). <br>
She has presented her work in dance theatres, galleries, schools, apartments, gardens, shops and cultural centres.
<br>
<br>
Luisa began training classical ballet at the Escuela de Ballet Cubano-Boliviana in La Paz at the age of 6 (Bolivia, 2004-2011) and continued training other contemporary and modern techniques with multiple schools and teachers in La Paz.
<br>
At the age of 16, Luisa left Bolivia under a full scholarship to complete the International Baccalaureate at the United World Colleges: Red Cross Nordic (Norway, 2013-2015), followed by her completion of a Contemporary Dance Bachelors Degree at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance, receiving an honorary mention. (England, 2016-2019).
<br>
<br>
Luisa started her professional performing career in Bolivia at a very early age, from collaborating in Maque Pereyra’s first choreographic investigations such as ‘es.pejo.es’ (Bolivia, 2012) to having the leading role in the revival of Norma Quintana’s 1996 neoclassical piece ‘The Passion of The Christ According to St. Luke’ (Bolivia, 2016).
<br>
Then she continued performing and collaborating in projects of diverse natures with artists such as Jo Fung (UK), Eve Stainton (UK), Bianca Scout (UK), Monika Błaszczak (Poland), Brandon Lagaert (Belgium), Alice Anderson (France-UK), Anna Talvi (Estonia), Jana Winderen (Norway), Jawara Alleyne (Jamaica-Cayman Islands-London), Maria Gorodeckaya (Russia), Sylbee Kim (South Korea), Covco (DRC-London), Hagit Yakira (Israel), Jianan Qu (China), Daniel Jacoby (Peru),  Sasha Pirogova (Russia), Stella Scott (UK), among others.
<br>
<br>
Simultaneously, she has done various kinds of placements and residencies, being able to observe and interact intimately with Teatro de los Andes (Bolivia), Dimitris Papaioannou (Greece), Peeping Tom (Belgium), Candoco Dance Company (UK), Residencia Immaterial (Bolivia), Marina Collard (UK) and Rahel Vonmoos (Switzerland).
